                    I am a photographer based in Switzerland but originally from Brazil/ Portugal. I’ve been living in Lucerne now for around 8 years. I am married and have 2 sons whom I love above everything in this world, but I also love photography, and dance, and music and a lot of other forms of expression, including ( and not less important) : I LOVE to talk! You will definitely notice that when we meet. I like to think that I am a nice, friendly, easy going person… But I guess I will let you decide that, hum?! That being said, if you are in Switzerland (or planning to be) and ever need a photographer with the description above i’am here for you!
